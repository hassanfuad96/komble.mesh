Keystore Created and Wired

- Generated an upload keystore and configured Gradle to sign release builds automatically.
- Added local configuration file and safe ignores so secrets don’t get committed.
Keystore Details

- Path: /Users/hassanfuad/Code/komblemesh/komble.mesh/keys/upload.jks
- Alias: upload
- Passwords:
  - Store password: Dylalee12
  - Key password: Dylalee12
Files Added

- keystore.properties at project root:
  
  - storeFile=/Users/hassanfuad/Code/komblemesh/komble.mesh/keys/upload.jks
  - storePassword=Dylalee12
  - keyAlias=upload
  - keyPassword=Dylalee12
- Updated .gitignore to keep secrets out of VCS:
  
  - Ignores keystore.properties and keys/ .
- Gradle config reads properties and applies signing to release :
  
  - app/build.gradle.kts:58–81 loads keystore settings and sets signingConfigs.upload .
Release Outputs

- Signed bundle: app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab
- Signed APK: app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
Commands Run

- Generated keystore:
  - keytool -genkeypair -v -keystore keys/upload.jks -alias upload -keyalg RSA -keysize 4096 -validity 36500 -storepass "Dylalee12" -keypass "Dylalee12" -dname "CN=KomBLE, OU=KomBLE, O=KomBLE, L=City, S=State, C=US"
- Built signed artifacts:
  - ./gradlew :app:bundleRelease :app:assembleRelease
Notes

- keystore.properties and keys/ are ignored by .gitignore . If you plan to share the repo, distribute the keystore and properties securely outside version control.
- You can upload app-release.aab to Play Console. Keep the upload keystore safe; it is required for future releases.
